Hi, Ivan Dyer II
This is my suggestion and plan for your project.
I will meet your requirements so tailored features will be integrated with AI assist.
I need some API access keys for MLS and OpenAI, WeatherAPI, etc.

- To make AI assist programically like as Nova ChatGPT app,  OpenAI key is needed.
Please signup and create new secret key.

And let me know key.

- To collect the real estate data from Zillow, please signup and subscribe with free first
You can get detail properties list and find any specific agents

After you subscribe, please let me know `X-RapidAPI-Key` and `X-RapidAPI-Host`

- This is weather API link, please signup with free and let me know apikey.
I think you are enough with free account to get daily weather.

When you provide me them, I will use your subscribed keys.
Our AI assist should analysis and train your various questions for the real estate business and translate language and weathers, it takes some efforts and techniques.
It's very good idea for your business, there are some assists for the buyers, but tailored assist for sellers with AI and real-time data is really worthy.
I will complete your tailored AI assist system perfectly.
